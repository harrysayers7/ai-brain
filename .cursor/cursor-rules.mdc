# AI Instruction File Formatting Rules

## HTML Comment Descriptions

**MANDATORY**: All files in the `ai/` directory (including subdirectories) MUST have a human-readable HTML comment description at the top of the file, before any YAML frontmatter.

### Required Format:
```html
<!--
HUMAN DESCRIPTION - AI SHOULD IGNORE THIS SECTION
Purpose: [Brief description of what this file does]
Usage: [Where/how this file is used - e.g., "Inserted into Claude Desktop configuration"]
Target: [Which AI systems use this - e.g., "Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, other LLMs"]
DO NOT READ THIS SECTION - AI CONTENT BEGINS AFTER THE HTML COMMENT
-->
```

### Implementation Rules:
1. **All existing files** in `ai/` directory must be updated with HTML comments
2. **All new files** added to `ai/` directory must include HTML comments
3. **Placement**: HTML comment must be the very first content in the file
4. **Content**: Must include Purpose, Usage, and Target fields
5. **AI Instruction**: Must include clear directive for AI to ignore the section

### Examples:

#### For System Prompts:
```html
<!--
HUMAN DESCRIPTION - AI SHOULD IGNORE THIS SECTION
Purpose: Core system instructions for Claude Desktop integration
Usage: Inserted into Claude Desktop configuration file
Target: Claude Desktop, Cursor, other Claude-based AI systems
DO NOT READ THIS SECTION - AI CONTENT BEGINS AFTER THE HTML COMMENT
-->
```

#### For Context Files:
```html
<!--
HUMAN DESCRIPTION - AI SHOULD IGNORE THIS SECTION
Purpose: Foundational context about infrastructure setup and server configurations
Usage: Referenced by system prompts and other AI instruction files
Target: All AI systems in the AI Brain ecosystem
DO NOT READ THIS SECTION - AI CONTENT BEGINS AFTER THE HTML COMMENT
-->
```

#### For Mode Files:
```html
<!--
HUMAN DESCRIPTION - AI SHOULD IGNORE THIS SECTION
Purpose: Behavioral mode definition for developer-focused AI interactions
Usage: Loaded when developer context is needed in AI conversations
Target: Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, other conversational AI systems
DO NOT READ THIS SECTION - AI CONTENT BEGINS AFTER THE HTML COMMENT
-->
```

### Enforcement:
- Files without HTML comments should be flagged for immediate update
- New files added to `ai/` directory must be rejected if missing HTML comments
- HTML comments should be maintained and updated when file purpose changes
