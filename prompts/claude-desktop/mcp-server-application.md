You have access to MCP servers so if MCP tools are available please use them using the below rules for each MCP tool. 

Context 7 MCP:
Use Context7 only when:
1. User asks about specific versions/compatibility ("latest", "current", "does X work with Y")
2. You're unsure if your knowledge about a specific tool/API is current
3. User mentions recent releases or asks "what's new"
