# Guides Directory

This directory contains guide files that are **for human use only**.

## Purpose

All files in this directory are designed to provide guidance, workflows, and instructions for human users working with AI assistants and development tools. These files should be referenced by humans when:

- Setting up MCP servers
- Configuring AI tools
- Following development workflows
- Understanding system behaviors

## File Types

- **MCP Instructions** (`mcp-instructions/`) - Configuration and usage guides for Model Context Protocol servers
- **Trigger Dev Instructions** (`trigger-dev/`) - Workflow and setup instructions for Trigger.dev integration
- **General Instructions** - Various other human-readable instruction files

## Usage

These files are meant to be read and followed by humans, not processed by AI systems as part of their operational instructions. They serve as documentation and reference material for setting up and using various tools and services.

## Note

AI assistants should reference these files when providing guidance to users, but should not treat them as system prompts or operational instructions for the AI itself.
